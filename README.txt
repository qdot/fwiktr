Fwiktr was a project I built in the summer of 2007 to teach myself some advanced python. It uses the Natural Language Toolkit (http://www.nltk.org/) along with a library for fetching flickr and twitter information. It pulls twitter messages from the public timeline, then uses tag searches on flickr to match them with images.

The end goal of the project was the overlay the twitter message on the image in some sort of artistic way. However, the project never made it much farther than picking out parts of speech and matching the nouns to flickr images. I haven't touched the code since that summer, and I'm not sure the API calls even work anymore, but the project is left here for posterity.
